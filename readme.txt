# Battleship: Luck Mode

## Description

**Battleship: Luck Mode** is a twist on the classic Battleship game, where players must find and hit **8 ships** while avoiding **hidden bombs** scattered across the board.  
Unlike traditional Battleship, there are **no enemy ships firing back** — your biggest challenge is testing your **luck** and making the **right choices**!

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a grid where ships and bombs are randomly placed.
- The player selects coordinates to fire at, revealing what’s hidden in that location.
- If a ship is hit, the player progresses toward victory.
- If a bomb is hit, the player moves closer to losing the game.
- The game ends when the player either finds **8 ships** (win) or hits **3 bombs** (lose).
